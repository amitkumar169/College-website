<li>Collage, from the French verb coller, meaning 'to glue,' is the artistic process of gluing and assembling various materials to a flat surface. Collage can refer to both the actual procedure of cutting and pasting (the verb), as well as to the final artistic product (the noun).

Think back to elementary school. Did you ever cut out magazine pages and glue them to a piece of paper for a homework project? Or maybe you made a scrapbook with vacation photos and stickers. You may have been a budding collage artist and didn't even know it!</li>
